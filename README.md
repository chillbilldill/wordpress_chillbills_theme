basic wordpress theme

This is an extremely simple WordPress theme that I coded from scratch. Feel free to use this for your project. It's also a good learning resource for studying the basic foundation of a WordPress theme. You can use the developer tools within your browser to inspect the code for a better understanding of what is under the hood. If you would like to create this theme from scratch, follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3EcEYFgyrQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> on YouTube. If you are looking for something a bit more advanced, I recommend checking out the WordPress starter theme called <a href="https://underscores.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underscores</a>. It was created by the team behind WordPress.
